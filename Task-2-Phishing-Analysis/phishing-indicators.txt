Phishing Indicators Identified:

1.Suspicious Sender Address
	->Displays as “UPS eNotification” but the actual email is: amazon@update-nt.com
	->This is not an official UPS domain.

2.Mismatched Branding
	->Email pretends to be from UPS but claims to come from “Amazon notification” in the sender address.

3.Urgency / Pressure
	->“If not picked up within 48 hours, it will be returned”
	->Classic social-engineering tactic to force quick action.

4.Suspicious Tracking Link
	->The tracking number link is not shown as a real UPS domain.
	->Potential malicious hyperlink.

5.Generic Greeting
	->The email says: “Dear,” with no name — typical in phishing emails.

6.Grammar & Formatting Issues
	->Missing space after commas.
	->Awkward phrasing (“Expected Deliver Date”).
7.Header Authentication Failures (from MXToolbox)
❌ DMARC Failed
❌ SPF Failed
❌ DKIM Failed
These failures indicate the email did NOT come from a legitimate mail server.

8.Suspicious Mail Server IP
	->Header shows sending server IP: 185.243.112.45
	->Not associated with UPS or Amazon.

9.Unusual Domain
	->update-nt.com is unrelated to UPS.
